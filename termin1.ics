DESCRIPTION:Software engineering stands apart from other engineering discip
	lines - or does it? Some argue that we are too informal to be deemed engin
	eers\, while others believe “real” engineers follow traditional\, wate
	rfall methods because things are much more stable in their domains. Some e
	ven argue that software development should be seen as an art or craft. To 
	address the question of whether software engineers are “real” engineer
	s\, Hillel Wayne interviewed professionals who crossed over from tradition
	al engineering to software engineering. In this episode\, we will delve in
	to the insights gained from these.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fomlv4tsubQ\nhttps:
