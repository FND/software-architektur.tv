# Live from OOP!

["Software Architecture in Stream"](https://software-architektur.tv/)
streams conversations about software architecture - and this year we
are broadcasting live from OOP! For this purpose we - Lisa Moritz and
Eberhard Wolff - have selected some speakers from OOP and talk to them
about aspects of software development and architecture.

The stream is interactive: viewers can ask their questions and post
comments via YouTube and Twitch chat. In this way, you can also engage
in exciting discussions with the OOP speakers remotely. You can watch
the stream at [https://www.youtube.com/user/ewolff](https://www.youtube.com/user/ewolff)
and [https://www.twitch.tv/ebrwolff](https://www.twitch.tv/ebrwolff).
